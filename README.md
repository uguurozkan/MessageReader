# MessageReader
The official repository of the MessageReader App.

This Android app is, mainly, intented for blind people, but it is suitable for everyone.


This app:
- notifies the user if a new SMS arrives
- tells the sender's name if any
- takes actions to user's commands (`READ`, `REPLY`, `DELETE`, and `IGNORE`) 
- completely runs on services, so there is no UI
